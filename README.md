# MULTITHREADING_1st 
In the example shown in slide about multithreadingprogramming to close child threads before the main thread ( so the main() method) I used isAlive() method.
Please modify this program in a way that we no longer use isAlive() method at all, for ensuring that children threads will be close before the main thread usejoin() method.
